# Wrodle
A terminal-based wordle clone that always will have daily, identical answers to the New York Times version.

## How it works
I have copied the wordlists (the files wlist and dict) from the New York Times version of the website, and performed the same algorithms on them (in the array, the index of today's wordle is the number of days since 19th June 2021, looped back if necessary) to produce identical words.

### CAUTION:
***This may create an emoji grid, however it will not update your statistics online. If you want to update your statistics you need to copy your results into the website.***
